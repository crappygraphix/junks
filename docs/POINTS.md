### NIX

Nix has a learning curve. Adding Haskell dependencies can be a bear due to version constraints. Starting from scratch first involves understanding Nix, which is a non-trivial endeavor. Simplest option is to find an existing project, copy the resources, and alter as necessary.

Having 3rd party libraries execute functions defined in Haskell as callbacks is trivial via FFI. Getting 3rd party libraries to integrate with the FRP Network is possible but feels hacky at best.
